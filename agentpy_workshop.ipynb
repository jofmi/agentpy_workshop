    "\n",
    "**Agent-based models** (ABMs) are computer simulations to generate and understand the dynamics of [complex systems](https://complexityexplained.github.io/) based on the autonomous behavior of heterogeneous agents. They show how the behavior of a system as a whole can emerge out of the actions and interactions of individual agents, each with their own set of rules, characteristics, and information. This method has found numerous applications in fields like [ecology](https://doi.org/10.3389/fevo.2018.00237), [cognitive sciences](https://doi.org/10.1177/0963721419834547), [management](https://oxford.universitypressscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195172119.001.0001/acprof-9780195172119), \n",
    "[economics](https://www.nature.com/articles/460685a), and [sociology](https://doi.org/10.1002/wics.1356).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Agentpy** is an open-source library for the development and analysis of agent-based models in Python. The framework integrates the tasks of model design, numerical experiments, and data analysis within a single environment, and is optimized for interactive computing with [IPython](http://ipython.org/) and [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/). If you have questions or ideas for improvements, please visit the [discussion forum](https://github.com/JoelForamitti/agentpy/discussions)\n",
    "or subscribe to the [agentpy mailing list](https://groups.google.com/g/agentpy).\n",
    "\n",
    "Within this framework, **agents** are represented as [objects](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/class) that can be placed within different **environments** like a network or a spatial grid. A **model** is used to initiate these objects, perform a simulation, and record data. **Experiments** can take a model and run it over multiple iterations with different parameter combinations. The resulting **output** data can be saved, loaded, and re-arranged for analysis and visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"structure.png\" alt=\"drawing\" width=\"500\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "**This workshop** will introduce you to the basic syntax of the agentpy package. Some basic knowledge of Python is required, but it is generally aimed at beginners. The following sections will show you how to design custom agents and models; use networks; visualize the dynamics of a simulation in an animation, perform experiments that run a model multiple times with different parameters; and run a sensitivity analysis on the output data. For more information about agentpy, check out the [documentation](https://agentpy.readthedocs.io/) and [model library](https://agentpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/model_library.html). "

If you have any feedback for improvements, please write to joel.foramitti@uab.cat. The project is in its early stage, and any help is very welcome. If you interested to contribute, please check out this [guide](https://agentpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing.html) and feel also free to write me.\n",

    "There you can also find some models with spatial topologies and other analysis methods such as scenario comparison and visualization with seaborn.\n",
